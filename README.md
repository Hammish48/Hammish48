## Bio
Hey there! I'm [Your Name], a passionate developer who loves to build cool stuff. My journey in the world of coding began when I was introduced to BASIC at a young age, and since then, I've been exploring various technologies and frameworks. I believe in the power of open source and love collaborating with other developers. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the outdoors or diving into a good book.
